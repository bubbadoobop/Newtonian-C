# TODO

* Create an *"infinite loop"* between menus, and make an easier user experience. Essentially, make it so you don't have to relaunch the program everytime you want to use it.
* Add a basic conversion functionality between units.
* Add a trig and vector calculator.
* Add an "over time" function. Basically, add Δt, Δv, **etc**.
