# Newtonian-C
Newtonian-C is a C program that can make high-school physics a breeze. With
it's simple usage, and small size. With Newtonian-C, you can work with the basics of...

* Kinematic systems
* Newtonian gravitational systems
* Waves
* Some geometric optics
* Very essential quantum physics
* Ohm's law

Now, you can probably take this into college, but, I cannot guarantee that it
will get you far. 



This program is not intended for academic dishonesty in any way, shape, or form. Thencefourth, any actions that may be perceived dishonest are not my fault, and the faculty of the school/university should deal with the student(s) based upon their actions individually. 
### Using Newtonian-C
___
*Taken from Documentation*

When using Newtonian-C, the first thing you will see is a menu, which, is pretty self explanatory.

```
Newtonian-C, by Ian Mitchell (c) 2017, Gnu GPL v3
Please pick an option from below 
-------------------------------------------------
 1) Kinematic system
 2) Wave system
 3) Gravitational System
 4) About

 --->
```
All you need to do is pick an option on the menu, and then add the neccesary values. For the sale of simplicity on this documentation, let's choose option 2 (Wave system), since it only has one value needed to operate. 

```

Please pick an option from below 
-------------------------------------------------
 1) Kinematic system
 2) Wave system
 3) Gravitational System
 4) About

 ---> 2
```

Upon choosing option number 2, and pressing ENTER (RETURN), you should see a screen that looks something like this...

-------------------------------------------------
 1) Kinematic system
 2) Wave system
 3) Gravitational System
 4) About

 ---> 2
 Please enter the Period (time) of the wave  
 >
```

Next, all you need to do is input the value needed. Let's say, 10.

```

Please pick an option from below 
-------------------------------------------------
 1) Kinematic system
 2) Wave system
 3) Gravitational System
 4) About

 ---> 2
 Please enter the Period (time) of the wave  
 > 10
  Period: T = 10.000000					    
  Frequency: f = 0.100000					    
  Angular Frequency: ω = 0.628318				    
  Amplitude = 100.000000					    
  Velocity: v = 6.283184					    
  Wavelength: λ = 62.831841
```

It will then output all the values calculated by the program.

### IMPORTANT
____

When using options 1 or 3, it will tell you to enter the values in the exact order it says. Falure to do so will result in misleading outputs, that are wrong in the context of whatever calculations that you may be making.
