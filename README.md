# Newtonian-C
Newtonian-C is a C program that can make high-school physics a breeze. With
it's simple usage, and small size. With Newtonian-C, you can work with the basics of...

* Kinematic systems
* Newtonian gravitational systems
* Waves

Now, you can probably take this into college, but, I cannot guarantee that it
will get you far.
